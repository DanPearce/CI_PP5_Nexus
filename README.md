Welcome to Nexus! Nexus is a social network built using React. Inspired by Instagram, this site allows users to share their images in posts to interact with other users on the site. Nexus is a community of users who like to keep in touch and share experiences on social media.

Nexus is paired with its sister application Nexus DRF, which is an API using the Django Rest Framework.

You can read more about the DRF Application following the links below:
